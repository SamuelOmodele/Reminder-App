Reminder App Documentation

Overview: The Reminder App is a single-page web application designed to help users set reminders and receive notifications when their reminders are due.

Installation: Clone the GitHub repository containing the Reminder App. Open the project in your preferred code editor, such as VS Code. In the terminal, navigate to the project directory. Run the command “npm install uuid” to install the uuid library, which is used for generating unique IDs for each reminder. Additionally, install the react-datepicker library by running “npm install react-datepicker date-fns”, which provides the time picker functionality for setting reminders. After the installation is complete, run the command “npm start” to start the development server.

Usage: Once the Reminder App is running, users can add new reminders by filling out the title, description, date, and time fields and clicking the "Set Reminder" button. Reminders are displayed in a list, showing their title, description, date, and time. Users can edit existing reminders by clicking the "Edit" icon next to a reminder. This allows them to modify the reminder details and save the changes. Users can delete reminders by clicking the "Delete" icon next to a reminder. This removes the reminder from the list. Reminders are stored locally, allowing users to access their reminders even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.

Features: Adding Reminders: Users can easily add new reminders by providing the necessary details in the input fields. Editing Reminders: Users have the ability to edit existing reminders, updating the title, description, date, and time as needed. Deleting Reminders: Users can remove reminders from the list by clicking the "Delete" icon next to each reminder.
